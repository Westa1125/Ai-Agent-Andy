# Ai-Agent-Andy

**Andy** is an AI-powered voice agent built for Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Electric. This agent handles real-time customer service calls, automates ServiceTitan tasks, and communicates with a set of MCP tools to perform actions like scheduling jobs, updating customer data, and retrieving invoices.

This repo is the full workspace for developing, maintaining, and scaling Andyâ€™s toolset and backend automation using:
- **n8n** (for workflows)
- **ServiceTitan API** (for job, customer, invoice, and appointment data)
- **Codex / ChatGPT** (for AI-assisted dev work)
- **GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

## ðŸ§  Project Purpose

Build a fully autonomous AI voice agent that:
- Books new jobs using ServiceTitan APIs
- Handles customer account updates
- Looks up invoices, payments, and memberships
- Applies business rules (e.g. service area, after-hours logic, memberships)
- Grows over time with new automations and sales intelligence
